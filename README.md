# Rhyming Program
this is a project that will show a list of words that rhyme with a given word and tell if two words rhyme, 
I intend to implement machine learning to detect slant rhymes eg; "regeime" and "queen".
project uses the CMU phonetic dictionary dataset. All words will be stored in a hash table with final syllable + trailing phoneme's.
